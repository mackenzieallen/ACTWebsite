            Place a standard unlined letter-size sheet of paper and a pencil in front of the patient and say, 
            <b>“I want you to draw a face of a clock with all the numbers on it.  Make it large.” </b> 
            After completion of the clock face, instruct as follows: 
            <b>“Now, draw the hands, pointing at 20 to 4.”  </b>
            Instructions may be repeated or rephrased if the patient does not understand, but no other help should be given.  
            The time taken to complete the task may be noted.
